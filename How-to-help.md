Please, note, that we are NOT designers, and can't do artworks. Fontello is our pet project, used to check [nodeca](https://github.com/nodeca/)'s new technologies & components. But we know, that designers like fontello. So, if you wish to improve it, there are several ways.

Donate us some of your icons
----------------------------

That's the best way to help :)

- It can be difficult to make big collection, but quite easy to draw a couple of images.
- We will care about font generation.
- That's an easy way to participate, if you like opensource development process

The only strict requirement is sharing your work under cc-by / cc0 or similar licence.

If you like to share a big icons collection under separate namespace (like Font Awesome, Entypo, Iconic and others) - it's possible too.

Help to improve fontello interface
----------------------------------

As you can see, we use twitter bootstrap styles. That does not affect quality of generated fonts :) . But if you feel, that you can add some beauty here, that would be interesting.
