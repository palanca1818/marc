Please note that we are programmers, and don't do artwork. Fontello is our pet project, used to check [nodeca](https://github.com/nodeca/)'s new technologies & components. But we know that designers like fontello. If you wish to improve it, there are several ways.


Share icons to fontelico collection
------------------------------------

- https://github.com/fontello/fontelico.font
- Just send us your image as a 1000x1000 SVG, and confirm that you agree to share it under CC BY


Share icons as separate font
----------------------------

If you have a lot of icons, and wish to share those under one of CC licenses - contact us with a request to create a separate collection for you.


Help to improve fontello interface
----------------------------------

If you have ideas of things that can be improved to increase your productivity with fontello - let us know.
