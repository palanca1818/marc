Please, note, that we are programmers, and can't do artworks. Fontello is our pet project, used to check [nodeca](https://github.com/nodeca/)'s new technologies & components. But we know, that designers like fontello. So, if you wish to improve it, there are several ways.


Share some of your icons
------------------------

- That's an easy way to participate in our opensource development process.
- Making a couple of images will not take too much of your time, and will help
  to increase a number of high quality icons, shared for everybody.
- We will care about font generation, and don't bother you about technical details.

The only strict requirement is sharing your work under cc-by / cc0 or similar licence.

If you like to share a big icons collection under separate namespace (like Font Awesome, Entypo, Iconic and others) - it's possible too.


Help to improve fontello interface
----------------------------------

As you can see, we use twitter bootstrap styles. And that does not affect quality of generated fonts :) . But if you feel, that you can add some beauty or usability here, that would be highly appreciated.
